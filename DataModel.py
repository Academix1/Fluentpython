Let’s create a real-world example by designing a **`BankAccount`** class to manage a bank account’s balance and transactions. We'll implement Data Model methods only as needed, demonstrating selective use of special methods to achieve a clear, intuitive interface.

### Real-World Example: BankAccount Class

#### Goals:
1. Keep track of the balance.
2. Support deposit and withdrawal operations.
3. Allow users to check the balance.
4. Enable comparison between accounts (e.g., `>` to see which has a higher balance).
5. Provide clear representations for debugging and display.

---

### Step 1: Basic Setup with `__init__`

We'll start by defining the account balance as an attribute initialized to zero or a provided value.

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance
```

---

### Step 2: Adding `__repr__` and `__str__` for Clarity

We want a readable representation for debugging (`__repr__`) and a user-friendly description (`__str__`).

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"BankAccount(owner='{self.owner}', balance={self.balance})"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Bank Account of {self.owner} with balance: ${self.balance}"
```

---

### Step 3: Adding Deposit and Withdrawal Methods

We need basic methods to deposit and withdraw funds. These aren’t Data Model methods but are essential to the functionality of our class.

```python
class BankAccount:
    # __init__, __repr__, __str__ as before
    
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Deposit amount must be positive.")
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > 0 and amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Invalid withdrawal amount.")
```

Now, we have a `BankAccount` class that can deposit and withdraw funds.

### Step 4: Adding Comparison with `__gt__` and `__lt__`

For users to compare account balances, we can add comparison methods like `__gt__` (greater than) and `__lt__` (less than).

```python
class BankAccount:
    # Previous methods

    def __gt__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, BankAccount):
            return self.balance > other.balance
        return NotImplemented

    def __lt__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, BankAccount):
            return self.balance < other.balance
        return NotImplemented
```

These methods allow comparisons like `account1 > account2` to check which account has a higher balance.

---

### Step 5: Adding Truthiness with `__bool__`

We might consider an account “active” (or `True`) if it has a positive balance and “inactive” (or `False`) if it’s zero.

```python
class BankAccount:
    # Previous methods

    def __bool__(self):
        return self.balance > 0
```

Now, `bool(account)` will return `True` if there’s a positive balance and `False` otherwise.

---

### Complete Code

Here’s the complete `BankAccount` class with all the methods we discussed:

```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, owner, balance=0):
        self.owner = owner
        self.balance = balance

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"BankAccount(owner='{self.owner}', balance={self.balance})"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Bank Account of {self.owner} with balance: ${self.balance}"

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Deposit amount must be positive.")
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > 0 and amount <= self.balance:
            self.balance -= amount
            print(f"Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Invalid withdrawal amount.")

    def __gt__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, BankAccount):
            return self.balance > other.balance
        return NotImplemented

    def __lt__(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, BankAccount):
            return self.balance < other.balance
        return NotImplemented

    def __bool__(self):
        return self.balance > 0
```

### Testing the BankAccount Class

Now, we can test our class to see how it works:

```python
# Create accounts
account1 = BankAccount("Alice", 500)
account2 = BankAccount("Bob", 300)

# Deposit and Withdraw
account1.deposit(200)         # Deposited $200. New balance: $700
account2.withdraw(50)         # Withdrew $50. New balance: $250

# Comparison
print(account1 > account2)    # True
print(account1 < account2)    # False

# Truthiness
print(bool(account1))         # True (balance > 0)
account3 = BankAccount("Charlie")
print(bool(account3))         # False (balance = 0)

# Representation
print(repr(account1))         # BankAccount(owner='Alice', balance=700)
print(account1)               # Bank Account of Alice with balance: $700
```

---

### Summary

We selectively implemented the following:

- **`__repr__` and `__str__`** for clear representations.
- **Custom methods** (`deposit` and `withdraw`) for core functionality.
- **Comparison operators (`__gt__` and `__lt__`)** to compare balances.
- **`__bool__`** to define truthiness based on the account balance.

This approach ensures that the class is clean, intuitive, and easy to use. The class follows Pythonic principles by using only the necessary Data Model methods, making it behave like a natural extension of Python’s core features.
